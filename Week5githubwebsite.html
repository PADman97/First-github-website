<h3>Biography:</h3> <br>
Raised on the hard streets of south side Dublin in the 80s, I spent my days searching for the best talent in the hip hop scene. This curiousity brought me to Brooklyn in the 90s where I hooked up with Suge Knight, Snoop and the boys. It wasn't long till I was mentoring Snoop, showing him the ways of the west coast hip hop culture. I actually co-wrote the song "What's my name?" with him.

From there I decided to switch it up and get into the restaurant business. I headed over to Great Britian in the lates 90s and wasn't long till I was head chef at Wickham Arms, where I gave Gordon his start. I quickly saw hidden talent in the young man and decided to let him take over the restaurant as head chef. These days however, he comes to me for advise on opening up new restaurants, tv ventures and business ideas.

For the last few years of my life I have been working closely with the man himself, Elon Musk, helping him through the design process of most of his Teslas. It was my idea to bring in the laptop for the dashboard, making it entirely possible to watch your favourite movie while you drive. Safe!
